# Middle-earth DevOps – Questions

Please answer briefly in your own words. Bullet points or short paragraphs are fine.

---

## 1. Terraform design

- How did you approach the dev/prod split?
- How would this approach scale if we later add a third realm (for example, **Rohan**)?

---

## 2. CI/CD integration

- How would you plug this Terraform into a pipeline using **GitHub Actions** or **Azure DevOps**?
- How would you:
  - Handle secrets (e.g. Azure credentials, state backend access)?
  - Prevent accidental prod deployments from a developer’s laptop?

---

## 3. AI usage

If you used AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT, Copilot), please answer:

- What did you use them for?
- How did you validate or adjust the output?
- Is there anything you chose not to use? Why?

---

## 4. If you had more time…

If you had another few hours, what would you improve or refactor in your solution?

(Structure, modules, linting, testing, naming, documentation, anything you like.)
