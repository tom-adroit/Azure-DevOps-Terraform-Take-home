# Middle-earth Infra (Terraform)

This folder contains a partially completed Terraform configuration for the Middle-earth environment:

- Resource Group
- Virtual Network and subnet
- App Service plan and App Service (`shire-api`)
- Key Vault (`one-ring`)
- A managed identity

Your task is to:

1. Fix issues and complete the existing configuration (`FIXME` / `TODO` comments in `main.tf`).
2. Extend the configuration to support a **prod** environment (**Gondor**) alongside **dev** (**The Shire**).
3. Keep the code readable and ready to grow.

You do **not** need to run `terraform apply` for this exercise.
